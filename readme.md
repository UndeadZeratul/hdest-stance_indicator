# HDest Stance Indicator
A simple addon for HDest that adds a "stance indicator" *(like the one you'd see in ARMA)*.

Thanks to PhysixCat for the idea.

---
Everything in this mod is configured through CVars,
because I can't be bothered to make custom menu stuff.

## CVars
### hdstance_posx, hdstance_posx
Determines the position of the stance indicator.

### hdstance_scalex, hdstance_scaley
Determines the scale of
the stance and speed indicator.

### hdstance_offsetx, hdstance_offsety
Determines the offset of the speed indicator.

### hdstance_alpha
Determines the alpha transparency of
the stance and speed indicator.

### hdstance_showspeed
If true, will display a speed indicator
below the stance indicator.

### hdstance_speedtext
The string used for indicating the speed.
